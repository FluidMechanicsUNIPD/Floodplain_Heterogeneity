# Meander Centerline Migration Model
This repository contains the source codes of the numerical model developed by Bogoni et al. WRR 2017 (http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2017WR020726/abstract).
Information about the model and the sctructure of input and output files are reported in the file README.pdf


CODE PROPERTIES
* The source code is written in Fortran 77/90 language, thus a Fortran compiler is required (e.g. gfortran).
* The code can be compiled through the script compile_unix (for UNIX/MAC) or compile_windows.cmd (for Windows).
* The folder 'input' contains a couple of templates.
* Input files must be into the 'input' folder, located in the same directory of the executable file.
* Folders 'temp' and 'output' are required in the same directory of the executable file.
